Data used for the City Transformation Plan dashboard's [adult literacy page](https://ct-data-haven.github.io/ctp-dash/pages/literacy.html) can be found here. Clicking on the links below will let you view that file. To save a data file that you are viewing, click the button that says "Raw," then use your browser's "Save As..." command.

As of September 2017, adult literacy data includes:

* [Adults without high school diplomas, 2000-2015](acs_no_high_school_diploma_trend.csv)
* [Adults without high school diplomas by location, 2015](acs_no_high_school_diploma_by_location.csv)
* [Adults without high school diplomas by neighborhood, 2015](acs_no_high_school_diploma_by_neighborhood.csv)
* [Adults without high school diplomas by race, 2015](acs_no_high_school_diploma_by_race.csv)

The data is hosted on GitHub in the [`literacy`](./) folder of this repository.

For technical users or anyone maintaining CTP datasets, [R scripts](../../../../R) are available under the `master` branch with Markdown documentation.
