As of June 2017, health data includes:

* [Adult asthma and dental visit rates by tract, 2014](500_cities_tract_current_asthma_dental_visit.csv)
* [Smoking and obesity rates by location, 2015](health_bars.csv)
* [Trends in rates of obesity, smoking, food insecurity, and health insurance coverage, 2012-2020 (goal)](health_trends.csv)

The data is hosted on GitHub in the [`health`](./) folder of this repository.

For technical users or anyone maintaining CTP datasets, [R scripts](../../../../R) are available under the `master` branch with Markdown documentation.
